Task: Revamp the flashcard generation, remove edit features, upgrade the "view" experience, and re-style your app UI to be visually distinctive and modern.

1. Flashcards Generator Enhancement

Generate a variety of flashcard styles from input content:

Term → Definition

Question → Answer

True/False

Fill-in-the-blank (as one variant, not dominant)

Make flashcards visually engaging: use colored backgrounds, bold typography, and relevant icons or images where possible.

Do not generate only fill-in-the-blank cards.

2. Flashcards Viewing Experience

Remove the "Edit" option entirely.

Make the "View" option interactive and fully functional:

When a user selects "View," display the flashcards in an attractive card-based UI.

Cards should be flippable (showing front and back), swipeable, or allow easy navigation between cards.

If possible, use subtle animations for flipping and transitions.

3. Study Library Functionality

Ensure the "Delete" option for each saved study material works instantly and updates the library view.

4. UI Design & Color Scheme

Redesign the app using a bold, unconventional color palette for instant visual impact.

Recommended palettes for 2025 include vibrant purples, saturated blues, coral, mint greens, and high-contrast combinations (e.g., neon over dark backgrounds or pastel with vivid accents).

Do not use previous color themes. Make the color scheme distinctly new and modern.

Apply minimal, clean layouts—no clutter; use clear buttons and interactive elements.

Add playful UI accents: emojis, animated illustrations, and dynamic transitions for flashcards or navigation.

5. Profile Section

Remove "Edit" from the profile section.

Ensure the "View" option displays all profile details dynamically and visually appealing, with profile photo and info formatted attractively.

6. Other Requirements

Notification features should remain removed.

All changes must deliver a uniquely modern, intuitive, and energetic user experience in line with 2025’s leading UI trends.
