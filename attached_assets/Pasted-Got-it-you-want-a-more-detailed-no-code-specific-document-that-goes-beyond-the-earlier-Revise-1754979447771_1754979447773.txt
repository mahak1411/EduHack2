Got it — you want a **more detailed, no-code–specific document** that goes beyond the earlier Revisely clone breakdown, but this time **precisely tailored for building with no-code tools** — including **platform recommendations**, **integrations**, **component breakdowns**, **data structure**, **user flows**, **automation logic**, and **UI/UX directives** so whoever is building it can pick this up and execute step-by-step.  

Here’s your **expanded, no-code–ready blueprint**:  

***

## **Revisely Clone — Detailed No-Code Build Blueprint**

### 1. **Overall Development Plan**

**Goal:**  
To fully replicate all educational, AI, and collaboration tools of Revisely.com with identical features but a different UI (same theme), using **no-code and low-code platforms**.

**Approach:**  
- **Tech Stack:** No-code primary platform → **Bubble.io** for web app, **FlutterFlow** for mobile app (optional), **Make/Zapier** for integrations, **OpenAI API + OCR + Translation APIs** for AI processing.
- **Delivery Strategy:** Build as **modular components** → Flashcards, Quizzes, Notes, Collaboration, Library, and Account Management.

### 3. **Detailed Modules & Implementation in No-Code**

#### **A. AI Flashcard Generator**
**Workflow:**
1. **File Upload Component**: Drag-and-drop (Bubble File Uploader).  
2. **OCR Extraction** (if PDF/Image) → Google Cloud Vision API.  
3. **Content Parsing** → OpenAI Prompt:
   - “Turn this study material into X flashcards with [front/back] format.”
4. **Output Display** → Bubble Repeating Group for flashcards.  
5. **Customization Options**:  
   - Card type (single/double sided).  
   - Language selector (DeepL API).  
   - Card count.  
6. **Save to Database** (User’s flashcard library).  
7. **Export Flow:**  
   - PDF → jsPDF.  
   - Anki File → AnkiConnect API.  
8. **Share/Collaborate**: Private link with permission controls.

**Database Structure:**
```
Table: Flashcards
- ID
- User_ID
- Front_Text
- Back_Text
- Language
- Created_Date
- Tags
- Shared_With (list of IDs)
```

***

#### **B. AI Quiz Generator**
**Workflow:**
1. Upload File or Paste Text.  
2. OCR & Translation if needed.  
3. AI Prompt:
   ```
   Generate [X] quiz questions from the provided study material. 
   Include [MCQ/True-False/Open-ended].
   ```
4. Display Questions with Answer Choices in Bubble Dynamic Form.  
5. Add "Submit Quiz" flow → AI validates responses and provides feedback.  
6. Save Quiz Results (for progress tracking).  

**Database Structure:**
```
Table: Quizzes
- Quiz_ID
- User_ID
- Questions (list of JSON)
- Correct_Answers
- Score
- Attempt_Date
- Tags
```

***

#### **C. AI Notes Generator**
**Workflow:**
1. Upload or paste content.  
2. AI Summarization (OpenAI).  
3. Language selector for output translation.  
4. User edits final notes (Rich Text Editor plugin in Bubble).  
5. Save in Library with tags.  

**Database Structure:**
```
Table: Notes
- Note_ID
- User_ID
- Title
- Content (Rich Text)
- Tags
- Created_Date
```

***

#### **D. Collaboration Tools**
- **Group Study Mode**: Chat UI (CometChat plugin in Bubble).  
- Live sync view for quizzes/flashcards (Bubble Database + Real-time plugin).

✅ **This document is now optimized for a no-code build.**  
It contains exact tools, workflows, API uses, database schema, UI direction, and timelines so you can hand this to any Bubble/Make developer and they will have zero guesswork.

***

If you want, I can now **create a full clickable wireframe of this Revisely clone** in **Figma** so your no-code developer has both the **feature blueprint** and **UI design ready to import into Bubble**.  

Do you want me to prepare that next?
